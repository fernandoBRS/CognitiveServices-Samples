# Cognitive Services Samples

This repository contains some Cognitive Services samples implemented in C#.
These samples can be useful if you want to explore Cognitive Services APIs programmatically to integrate them with your applications.

Some samples were adapted from official Cognitive Services repository on Github in order to bring better user experience and other samples were created from scratch based on official documentations.
